Here is my first project of Data cleaning :) 
I choose a database from kaggle named Layoffs and start working on cleaning the db.
As beginner, I would be happy to received feedbacks or recommendations (general appreciation / how to improve my queries).
Thanks for your time, hope my project was interesting and clear enough!
